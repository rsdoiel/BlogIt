Installation for development of **BlogIt**
===========================================

**BlogIt** __BlogIt__ is a command line program for curating front matter in Common Mark (Markdown) documents used in producing a blog. It also copies the Common Mark document which validated 
front matter into your blog&#x27;s directory tree.

Here&#x27;s an example of creating a blog from scratch while levaraging __BlogIt__

~~~shell
# Pick an editor, example nano in the case
export EDITOR&#x3D;nano
mkdir -p $HOME/Site/website/blog
cd $HOME/Site/website
# Create your first post
nano $HOME/Documents/FirstPost.md
# Create/curate the Front Matter for your first blog post
BlogIt edit $HOME/Documents/FirstPost.md
# Check to make sure everything is ready to go
BlogIt check $HOME/Documents/FirstPost.md
# Publishing into your blog&#x27;s directory tree
BlogIt $HOME/Document/FirstPost.md
# See the blog post ready in your blog directory
tree blog
~~~

Run a Common Mark to HTML converter like Pandoc on the Common Mark files to produce HTML. Then you&#x27;re ready to run [PageFind](https://pagefind.com) for search and 
[FlatLake](https://flatlake.app) to render your blog&#x27;s JSON API.
