  "description": "__BlogIt__ is a command line program for curating front matter in CommonMark (Markdown) documents used in producing a blog. __BlogIt__ primary purpose is curating the fornt matter \nposts. It also supports a preprocessor for handling markdown linked files as HTML linked files and code include blocks.
